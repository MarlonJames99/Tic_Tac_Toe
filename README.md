## Project:
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to play on the web with your friends!
The game is not online so you and your friend would need to be playing on the same computer.

### Rules: <br>
Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ' O' or an ' X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.
In addition, I also developed media queries to adapt the application responsively to different screens and devices.

## Next steps:
> The next step that I have planned to implement in this application are improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be used properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
